    "### Data Challenge Description : Face Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, face recognition systems have achieved extremely high levels of performance, opening the door to a wider range of applications where reliability levels were previously prohibitive to consider automation. This is mainly due to the adoption of deep learning techniques in computer vision. The most widely adopted paradigm is to train a $f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ which, from a given image $im \\in \\mathcal{X}$, extracts a feature vector $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ which synthesizes the relevant features of $im$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recognition phase then consists, from two images $im_1, im_2$, in predicting whether or not they correspond to the same identity. This is done from the extracted features $z_1, z_2$."

    "## General feedback regarding the MDI 343 Data Challenge (previous Data Challenge)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the strategy adopted for the first data challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first data challenge I followed the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1/ Data investigation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the type of the features\n",
    "- Handle missing values \n",
    "- Check if the dataset contains binary features\n",
    "- Analyze train labels distribution after preprocessing\n",
    "- Analyze correlation between features\n",
    "- Apply ``PCA``\n",
    "\n",
    "**2/ Data preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drop duplicate elements\n",
    "- Convert type of columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**3/ Features selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the best features to simplify the classification task by applying several features selection model such as ``Featurewiz``, ``ElasticNet`` and ``Random Forest Feature Importance`` \n",
    "\n",
    "**4/ Apply Machine learning algorithms on initial features and features which are selected by at least two times by the previous feature selection model**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical learning model: ``SVM``, ``k-NN``, ``Decision Tree``\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assembly models such as ``Random Forests``, ``Adaboost``, ``XGBoost`` and ``Gradient Boosting``\n",
    "\n",
    "- Voting Classifier that encompass several best classfiers models for the binary classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**6/ Generate new features (Enlarged strategy)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generation of new features by performing linear combinations between the initial features. In fact, between the vectors $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ such as $Z_{1} + Z_{2}$, $Z_{1} - Z_{2}$ and $Z_{1} * Z_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/ Fit the best model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**8/ Predict the label with the best model on the entire train dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy led to different results which are available in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table summarizes the different approaches and models that were tested for the first version of the data challenge as well as the result obtained on the initial performance metric for each model and approach.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We could see that the features selection did not have the expected effect, since when I trained a model on the whole dataset without going through the feature selection step, it gave better results as we could see with the model ```XGBoost```and the others boosting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the boosting models provided the best performance. The best performing boosting model for the first data challenge seems to be the ``CatBoost`` algorithm. But I managed to improve the performance by doing a majority vote between ```XGBoost```, ```LightGBM```, ```CatBoost```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I managed to further improve the performance of my model by creating new features via linear combinations between features. Extending the number of explicative variables of the input dataset seems to improve the performance of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the fist data challenge, I realized that refining the hyperparameters of machine learning models can be tough task. However, when hyperparameters are well chosen, they usually lead to better performing models. Also, it was noticed that boosting models are better when they work together thanks to and when they are combined with a majority voting system."

    "## Overall Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously explained, since this new data challenge uses the same data as the previous one, there is no need to perform a data analysis as this has already been done extensively for the first data challenge. It is possible to review the exploratory analysis I made for the first data challenge by consulting directly my github, the notebook is available \n",
    "[here](https://github.com/hugo-mi/MDI343_Data_Challenge_Face_Recognition/blob/main/MDI_343_Data_Challenge_Hugo_Michel.ipynb \"here\") \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it will be interesting to perform a deeper exploratory analysis of the columns ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` which are crucial columns for the fairness metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, through the experience of this first data challenge, we know that the generation of new features can improve the performance of the model. In addition, dimension reduction, in order to simplify the classification model by applying different feature selection models, does not seem to be a good option for this data challenge at least as far as only the performance metric is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the strategy I will opt for is to reuse the model with the best performance of the first data challenge as a baseline model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The real challenge of this data challenge is to find the proper trade-off between the two metrics. To achieve this, one of possible good approach is to train the model on a **custom metric**."

    "As mentioned before, the idea here is not to do an exploratory analysis because this has already been done for the first version of the data challenge. However, it can be interesting to take a closer look at the features that are determinant with the performance of the equity, namely the features ``X[8]`` (8th column of the train dataset) and ``X[56]`` (56th column of the train dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "When I did the exploratory analysis for the first data challenge, I can observed that the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` seems to be binary columns. However, it was impossible to give any real meaning to these two features. Now with the second data challenge, we know that these columns refer to the gender of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it will be interesting to do further exploratory analysis of the ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` columns which are the defining columns for the equity metric. For example, it would be interesting to look at the distribution of these two variables and thus find out if women are as well represented as men in the data set. When sampling, a balance must be struck between representativeness and critical mass constraints. For data sampling, we know that the goal is to ensure that samples are statistically representative of future cases that a given model is likely to encounter. This is generally a good practice. In our case the gender imbalance distribution could reduce the equity performance of the model. Therefore, it is appropriate to conduct a more in-depth exploratory analysis by focusing primarily on these two columns. "

More surprisingly, it is difficult to see on the graph that the values taken by ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` can be different from **0** and **1**. Indeed, we can hardly see at the bottom of the graph the bars that appear for different values of **0** and **1**. This is surprising because these columns are supposed to be binary given that they describe the gender of the person.\n",

    "Logic would dictate that it is advisable to treat these outliers by simply removing them from our dataset to avoid that they mislead our prediction model and attenuate the performances of the model on the fairness metric. But before to do this drop treatment it is important to inspect the distribution of the test dataset. If the distribution of the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` in the test dataset is similar to the distribution of the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` that we observed on the training dataset, then it is not advisable to process these outliers because even if this could lead to better performance when predicting on our training dataset (once our train dataset cut into the train and valid sets), when predicting the model on the test set set that was provided to us in order to make prediction for the data challenge, the model could have difficulties to make good prediction on exceptional cases because these exceptional cases could not be learned by the model since they were removed from the training dataset. Hence, It will be interesting to observe the distribution of the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` from the ``test_data`` dataset."

    "\n",
    "If we summarize, first of all the good point is that the gender ratio is not really unbalanced. On the other hand, we could see 2 surprising phenomena with our training dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1st phenomenon**: It turns out that the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` which are supposed to be binary because they describe a phenomenon that is binary namely the gender of the person which cannot be (Male or female). Since the values are between 0 and 1, we can then deduce that this column assigns probabilities to the gender of the individual \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2nd phenomenon**: It also turns out that our training dataset contains templates $Z1$ and $Z2$ which have different values for features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` which means that the person associated with one of the templates is of the opposite gender to the person associated with the other template. This implies that the target variable is set to 0 but we have seen that this is not always the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it was advisable to see if these phenomena that we have observed can ben also found in the ``test_data`` dataset (dataset that will be used for the prediction before the submission of the prediction file on the data challenge website). Unfortunately the second phenomenon can't be checked because we don't have access to the label of the test dataset because the goal of a data challenge is to predict these labels. On the other hand it were possible to observe the first phenomenon. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the distribution of the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` in the test dataset is rather similar to the distribution of the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` in the training dataset as the distribution of the genders for the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` in the test dataset are balanced. Morevoer the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` take different values of 0 and 1. Therefore, I made the choice not to remove the data describing these exceptional cases, so that my model could be robust to these exceptional cases."

But before to do that I want to know the impact of the different datasets on the fairness metric. We already know that the dataset containing the new features leads to better performance but we also need to see which of these two datasets allow the models to be as fair as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I already know that the ensemble models are the ones that give the best performance results for the 1st data challenge. Moreover, when a voting is applied on several ensemble learning algorithms, it further improves the performance of the model. It remains to be seen how these models behave with respect to the fairness metric.\n",

    "For that, before applying the voting model with which I had the best performance, I would like to know the performance of ensemble learning algorithms such as ``LightBoost``, ``CatBoost`` on the fairness metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally when I know which is the best model, It will then be necessary to perform a fine tuning of the hyperparameters to find the combination of hyperparameters allowing to obtain the best trade off on the 2 metrics (performance ,fairness).\n",
    "\n",
    "furthemore, after a quick reading some scientific articles about the topic of fair models in machine learning. I selected  several techniques that contribute to improve the fairness performance of a machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first approaches to mitigate unfairness is to perform a feature selection. This means evaluating and identifying the correlation of features that are closely related to the feature indicating the gender of the individual. In our case, this means removing the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` and all the features correlated to these two features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 other techniques are also mentioned in the scientific literature are the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization during training is one way of adding fairness to machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize for the chosen fairness constraints by adding them to the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last approach is more difficult to implement because it requires to modify the objective function of the model. Indeed, the ideal would be to inject in the loss function of the model the performance and fairness metrics and thus train the model to find natively the best trade-off between performance and fairness.\n",
    "But the problem is that the Fairness and Performance Score metrics are not differentiable and therefore it is not possible to include these metrics in the loss function of the model because it will be difficult to minimize this loss function since optimization algorithms such as gradient descent (1st optimization order) cannot be applied in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The only approach that can be applied in our case is **free gradient optimization**. The goal would be to define a custom metric combined with the use of optimization tools such as ``optuna`` to find the best combination of model hyperparameters."

    "The performance of a voting model including 3 ensemble learning algorithms such as {``XGBoost``, ``Catboost``, ``LightGBM``} provides performances on the 2 metrics very close to the ``CatBoost`` and ``LightGBM`` model on the fairness metric even if the performance of the voting model provides very slightly better than ``CatBoost`` and ``LightGBM``. In conclusion, the voting approach does not seem to be beneficial regarding the time needed to train this model."

    "The use of a tool such as optuna to fine tune the hyperparameters of the models did not allow here to improve the performance of the model on the fairness and performance metrics. The idea here was rather to verify that the custom metric that I designed is the right one and it turns out that it seems to work well because we find the same results that we obtained for the ``Random Forest`` model that we used previously by varying the ``n_estimators`` parameter. We concluded that the model that gave the best trade-off between the 2 metrics was the ``Random Forest`` model with **1 estimator**. It turns out that the optimizing framework of the optuna hyperpatameters returns the same model. We deduce that the custom metric I designed is the right one and seems to work well.\n",

Therefore, we should now explore the approaches that have been mentioned in the scientific literature to significantly improve the fairness of the model without degrading its performance."

    "It is quite clear that hiding the features ``X[8]`` and ``X[56]`` from the model as well as the features that are closely correlated with the features related to the gender of the individual during training, leads to better results on the performance of the fairness. Indeed, the ``BFPR`` and ``BFNR`` scores have drop well for the 2 datasets ``dataset_initial_features`` and ``dataset_enlarged_features``. Moreover, the gain in terms of performance seems to be obtained with the dataset in its **enlarged** version seems to show that it is the best dataset offering the best compromise on the performance and fairness metric even if, the ``BFNR`` score is slightly degraded with this dataset compared to the dataset using the initial features. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, I conducted an exploratory analysis of the gender data. I was able to highlight some inconsistencies in the data set. However, since the distribution of the training and test dataset was roughly identical and these same anomalies were also found in the training and test dataset, I chose not to post-process the data so as not to diminish the quality of the model predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthemore, for this second data challenge, I relied on the good feedback I had acquired during the first data challenge. I could see that the creation of new features brings a significant improvement in the accuracy of the model predictions. So I naturally re-used this technique to maximize my performance score and observed the performance of the models on the fairness metric. These models served as my baseline. However, as we have seen, when we want to maximize the performance of the model, it loses in fairness. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the right trade-off between performance and fairness, I tested different techniques: \n",
    "- Combine into a ``VotingClassifier`` model that encompasses 1 efficient model on the fairness metric such as a simple ``Random Forest`` and 2 efficient models on the performance metric {``LightGBM``, ``CatBoost``}\n",
    "- Perform free gradient optimization by constructing a custom metric to find the right combination of parameters to have the right trade-off between performance and equity\n",
    "- Perform a feature selection by hiding from the model during its training the features related to gender and the features closely correlated to these features.\n",
    "- Perform regularization during the training of a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, all these techniques, even when they are combined, did not allow me to design a model that would allow me to obtain a good compromise between performance and fairness. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, I test a last approach that consists to train a first model to predict only male inidiviuals and training a second model to predict only females. This would allow to have 2 very efficient models depending on the gender of the individual to predict. Finally the objective is to combine these 2 models in a ``Stacking Classifier`` to take the best of the 2 models. I think that this would have allowed to have a good compromise between performance and equity. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a final result for this approach because this approach was too long to train on my personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the goal of a data challenge is to obtain the best possible rank, I chose to focus on the fairness metric and to design a model able to be very good on this metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons I learned from this data challenge is that it is sometimes not easy to design a model that is both efficient and fair. Indeed, data is the reflection of the real world. The information we have gathered from the past is, unavoidably, biased or unfair. But the bias embedded in the data are usually overlooked and inherited by the ML models which might cause negative social impacts."
